# The Phantom Troupe Club

In this project I built an exclusive clubhouse where club members can write anonymous posts. Inside the clubhouse, members can see who the author of a post is, but outside they can only see the story and wonder who wrote it.



## Demo

## Description
- When Users sign in for the first time, they're given the 'visitor' status, which only allows them to see the messages without knowing who actually sent them nor see his avatar.
- Only club members and admins can write messages.
- To join the club you have to provide a pass code (hint: the code is walid123).
- Only admins can delete messages.
- To change to admin status you have to provide an admin password (chrollo123).
- During sign up, the user is asked to choose his avatar, which are photos of The Phantom Troupe members from Hunter x Hunter anime. The default avatar is Chrollo's.
- You can sign as visitor if you don't want to waste time filling the form.
